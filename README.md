### Sherlock Holmes

"Yes; one of my natural enemies, or, shall I say, my natural prey. Briefly, Watson, I am in the midst of a very remarkable inquiry, and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots, as I have done before now. Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour's purchase; for I have used it before now for my own purposes, and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me. There is a trap-door at the back of that building, near the corner of Paul's Wharf, which could tell some strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights."

"What! You do not mean bodies?"

### Jekyll & Hyde

“And surely none stranger than itself,” echoed the lawyer in the same tones. “For what did Jekyll”--he caught himself up at the word with a start, and then conquering the weakness--“what could Jekyll want with it?” he said.

“You may say that!” said Poole.
